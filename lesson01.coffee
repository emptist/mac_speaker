    title: "A Private Conversation"
    paragraph: "Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I couldn't hear the actors. I turned around. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I couldn't bear it. I turned round again. ‘I can’t hear a word!’ I said angrily. ‘It’s none of your business,’ the young man said rudely. ‘This is a private conversation!’"
